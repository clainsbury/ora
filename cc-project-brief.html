Pain Points
Multiview and Ascensus have called out a few recurring issues. Please make sure to avoid repeating these mistakes:

Content needs to speak to chemists and engineers. Don’t oversimplify the content and do not shy away from technical jargon
Task Instructions
REVIEW Multiview’s content brief for details
WRITE an informative and well-researched piece that follows tone/voice guidelines
Format of Work
Standard blog structure
H1: Title
H2: sections
H3: subsections, to be used sparingly
Tone/Voice Guidelines
Ascensus content is inherently complex and that must be reflected in your writing
Use technical jargon
When possible, include chemical formulas
Dig into the content and avoid high-level or shallow explanations
Overall, these pieces are thought leadership and the quality of writing and depth of information must reflect that
Note on Boilerplating, Plagiarism and Spinning
Plagiarism, boilerplating and spinning is NOT ALLOWED at Crowd Content. Anyone caught doing these things on orders will be removed from the platform.
Note on AI-Generated Content
Under no circumstances is it acceptable to submit AI-generated content on our platform, including our marketplace and managed services. This policy extends to AI-generated and human-edited content, as the finished deliverable is still not 100% human written. Freelancers who violate this policy will be permanently banned from our platform and may forfeit unpaid funds if those orders require a rewrite.
