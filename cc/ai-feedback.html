Hey Nicole - 

Hope you're well. I'm sure you've been pummeled with questions relating to ChatGPT...so hopefully this should be a pretty easy ask. 

I have a few questions: 
What is Crowd Content's position on using ChatGPT to create content? Does it get used today at CC?
Are there any safeguards CC has in place to ensure writers are not using it?
Do you notify clients when ChatGPT is being used?
Context: 
We have reason to believe that ChatGPT was used for some of the Capital One Tech Marketing content (see examples below). We want to make sure there is transparency when external generative AI is being used so we can be more critical of the claims and content. Furthermore, knowing how expensive tech content is, if ChatGPT is being used to speed up production, we'd want to see similar reductions in timelines and fees. I'd like to open the door to these conversations. 

Please let me know if you think a call is best!

---------

Example 1:

CrowdContent:

Flutter has emerged as a game-changing technology that effectively addresses both engineering and design needs during the development process. Its multi-platform, design-oriented approach makes it an ideal framework for building attractive apps for every platform while maintaining exceptional user experiences.

ChatGPT:

Flutter has emerged as a powerful and versatile framework for developing cross-platform applications. Its combination of a single codebase, expressive UI, and fast development cycles make it an attractive choice for developers and businesses alike.

Example 2:

CC:

In the realm of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, creating captivating and delightful experiences for users is a constant pursuit. One powerful approach that has gained significant traction is gamification. By leveraging an understanding of human psychology, gamification taps into the innate desire for challenge, achievement, and rewards, elevating the user experience to new heights.

ChatGPT: 

Gamification is a powerful tool for enhancing user engagement. With an approach that leverages human psychology and user experience principles to create delightful products, gamification has gained significant traction in recent years as businesses and even educational institutions recognize its potential to transform non-gaming contexts.

Example 3:

CC:

The cloud offers numerous advantages, including scalability, flexibility and cost efficiency... Choosing a cloud computing environment requires careful consideration of numerous factors, including your specific use case, cost, scalability, performance, security, compliance and the skills of your team. The chosen cloud provider should align with the technological needs and business goals of your organization. 

ChatGPT:

Cloud computing has become increasingly popular due to its flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. When selecting a cloud computing environment, there are several key considerations to keep in mind. By evaluating these factors, you can ensure that you choose a cloud environment that best aligns with your specific needs and requirements.

All the best,
Travis

Hi Darby,
 
We used 2 tools below to detect AI-generated content in the most recent project we submitted. I’m highlighting passages of text below that were flagged between 60-75% suspected AI across both tools. We don’t have a problem with the writers using AI as a research tool to help gather information but our concern is more these tools flagging the content as AI written. If Google uses similar tools we might see a drop in SEO effectiveness with this content. Can you let me know if our concerns are misplaced here or if we can leave feedback along these lines for the writer?

Hi Nicole -

Hope you are doing well!  I have a quick question for you.  One of our clients just reached out to claim that the content they received was written by ChatGPT.  Before I respond to them, I wanted to confirm that none of the content from Crowd Content is created by AI, correct?

Thanks!

Sure, let's set up a call so we can figure this out. We're available 10 am CT on Friday if that works for you.


We don't want our writers using ChatGPT to create content for Capital One. We need writers with hands-on tech experience that can contribute their unique insights to the draft, not somebody certified to create prompts for ChatGPT.


Thanks for the update on the Flutter piece! I'm really hoping the piece has what we're looking for.


Best,




Hi Darby,
Thank you for passing on the information to the writer. I was happy to see that the article was ready for review this morning. However, upon checking it for AI-generated text, I found that the content is not 100% human.
Adding AI-generated content is detrimental to our website, as we operate in a YMYL niche and we don’t want to send any bad signals to Google regarding our E-E-A-T in the legal space.
For checking, I used 2 tools:
sapling.ai—24.2% fake. You can find its report here based on 2,000 characters of text.
https://contentatscale.ai/ai-content-detector/—42% fake, based on the full article





Do you think these scores could be improved? Also, does crowdcontent.com have any QA policies in place to safeguard clients from AI-generated content?
Thank you,
Giorgiana

Hey Richard,

I wanted to follow up here because on our Veeam call yesterday, they brought up that some of the copy has been flagged as AI or duplicate copy among the web. Most of the examples they brought up were relating to terms being repeated throughout the copy that sounded a little "less human"; i.e. the word "robust" appearing several times throughout the article making it sound more AI-like. They shared that their internal team uses https://gptzero.me/ to flag these issues.

Would it be possible for your team to run the copy through this tool (or something similar) before sending us the final copy? I think this could cut down on revisions/ back and forth feedback.

I did reassure them that we don't use AI to generate content, so some of these "issues" might be coincidental, but thought I would inform you regardless.

Thanks!

Hi, 

We are not happy with the service. We just issued an order for a blog, and the person literally issued the order using 50% chat gpt. attached is the proof. 

How can we get a refund for the remaining balance?

Hey,

I've started seeing content from writers that looks (and is tested as) being written by AI. What am I to do about this? For instance, the article I just rejected, 'Most Walkable Neighborhoods in Raleigh', failed Copyleaks.com's AI test. I asked for a four star writer on this and would have expected higher quality.

From Assmbly - they reached out via Slack message to flag this. Content was re-written. Assembly’s flagged a number of pieces, I’ve found 4 instances so far. 







Thu, Jul 13, 1:59 PM




Hi Rick,
Just flagging a couple orders from the assmbly account that they flagged, the writer went well over the word count which assembly didn't want, but main issue is both pieces are flagging as really high potential for AI. We're going to ask for a re-write from the freelancer, but may have to comp or get this re-written with someone else too. 
Attached doc here for your reference, as the content may be removed/edited by the time you can get to it.

Hey Ricky - I'm done reviewing the article, and disappointingly, the entire piece looks like it's been generated using AI - with a bad prompt. The overall quality is just terrible, it's no different from the problematic articles we used to get from the marketplace. I provided detailed comments in the doc - but please see the summary of my feedback below:
Writer did not follow our content guidelines: There's no featured image, no meta copy provided, did not use proper headings. Everything is just H2 (please see my edits). I also said during our call that the article should be written in/copied to the content brief doc. It's in a separate doc.
Article doesn’t have a good flow. Poor transition from one section to another, even from one sentence to the next. Writing is choppy. Instead of each sentence supporting the previous ones, they all sound like separate ideas. Example: “The gig economy presents challenges for the IRS and taxpayers. Consequently, the IRS made some rule changes that small business owners who use contract workers must follow. Additionally, small business owners must contend with an increase in the minimum wage, which varies by region. No employers in California can ask workers to work mandatory overtime without paying overtime wages.” This looks more like a list of information instead of a paragraph in an article.
So many redundancies. The same terms are repeated multiple times, so close to each other.
feel like I didn’t learn a lot from this article. If I were the reader, I would’ve stopped reading not even halfway through, and looked for a better reference. We barely touched each point. Most of the things are defined in 1-2 short sentences - no in-depth explanation of the important points.
The article basically just presented facts instead of providing valuable insights. Plus, with the headers being all questions, it looks like a huge FAQ sheet.
There's no story here. Just plain facts. 
Zero creativity.

Hi there,


How are you, hope all is well.


I'm using your services for a while now and i'\m happy with it so far. I was hoping that you can help out a bit. My website is'nt getting the traffic that i want yet. I'm beginning to doubt a bit that it's due to the written texts. Can you tell me more about how you check that texts are not written by AI tools for example and how the texts are unique and not copied?


Nowadays several ways to check for AI written content are used and one thing is for sure, search engines don't like them: https://openai.com/blog/new-ai-classifier-for-indicating-ai-written-text/

Hi Jameson,

Thanks for this!

For clarity, the Originality.AI score doesn't mean it has identified 83% of the copy as AI-generated. This is a probability model that simply ensures that Google won't flag the content as AI-generated, which could negatively impact performance, so that's why we check. 

This probability result could be due to the use of writing/editing tools or other factors like article length and tone, as you pointed out. This could also just be a false positive. (For more info, here is Originality.AI's score details page.)

So, because this is one instance and not multiple, I don't want to definitively say that the writer used AI—I trust your team's expertise.

It's also important to note we just started using this tool, so we may encounter hiccups from time to time.

I hope this helps, and I cc'd Joe on this message for visibility and further feedback.

Regards,

Francois



Hi Francois,

How's it going?

I wanted to reach out via email, as it's much easier than leaving a lengthy comment in a Google Sheet. I saw your feedback on the "What is a Payment Gateway" piece and just wanted to address some concerns.

We take suspicions of AI-generated content very seriously. With any client, our target is 0% AI-generated content. BWZ is paying for high-quality, human-written content and we have a zero tolerance policy with AI. Once I saw your feedback, I launched our usual investigation process:
Our director of content and myself ran the piece through 6 AI detectors
Results varied from 100% human to some sentences being flagged as possibly AI-generated (don't you just love reliable tools?)
The writer in question is one of our oldest ones (she's been on the Crowd Content platform for about 5 years). We ran orders she wrote more than 2 years ago (well before the AI boom) through detectors and they all received some form of flagging. This leads me to believe that it may be her writing style (academic, matter-of-fact, short-ish sentences) that leads detectors to flag content. She's also one of the more prolific writers on the BWZ team, having done more than 15 orders in the past.

I'm happy to send this one back to the writer, but does Originality highlight specific sections that it considers problematic or likely to be AI-generated? I can use any guidance to have her rework flagged sections or simply get it rewritten altogether.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Jameson Worth

Hi Patrick,

I was given your email address by our customer success manager, Darby Houliston. She's out of the office right now and provided me with your contact information in case we needed any help while she's away.

Unfortunately, we have a problem with a new writer, June Marais. She's rated by Crowd Content as a 4-star writer, but after reviewing her submitted pieces, it's clear that she's either a non-native English speaker or using some AI generator. The majority of her submitted content is awkward, grammatically incorrect, lacking complete sentences, and generally not to the level of other 4-star writers at Crowd Content. 

I've attached a couple of screenshots for reference so that you can see for yourself what I'm talking about. I wrote her lengthy feedback in my requested revisions for 2 of the 3 local pages we outsourced, but having looked at the third page just now, I'd like for a new writer to write these for us:
Portland Local Cooling Page
Damascus Local Cooling Page
Salem Local Cooling Page

Please let me know how you might be able to help us proceed. As an agency, we rely on Crowd Content for reliable quality. 

Thank you!
Emily
